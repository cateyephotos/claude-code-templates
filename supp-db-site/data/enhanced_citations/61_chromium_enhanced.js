Chromodulin mediates insulin receptor activation; GLUT4 translocation enhanced via cholesterol-dependent and AMPK-mediated mechanisms. Clinical benefits most consistent in type 2 diabetes patients (HbA1c reduction -0.55 to -0.71%), with mixed results in non-diabetic and Western populations. Safety well-established at recommended doses (200-1000 mcg/day). Chromium picolinate is the most studied and efficacious supplemental form."

Transferrin serves as the transport protein for chromium to insulin-sensitive cells. Chromium picolinate enters cells via a different mechanism involving reduction of the chromic center."
